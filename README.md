OpenWebRX+ · Dadaloop82 Fork
=========

> **Fork by [dadaloop82](https://github.com/dadaloop82)** — Powered by Dadaloop82 🎧

This fork adds automatic signal recording, a files browser with audio visualization, and UI enhancements on top of the excellent [OpenWebRX+](https://github.com/luarvique/openwebrx) by luarvique.

## 🆕 Features added in this fork

### 🎙️ Automatic Squelch Recorder
- **RMS-based signal detection** — automatically records when audio signal exceeds a configurable threshold (default: 0.015 RMS on float PCM)
- **FLOAT32 → INT16 conversion** — correctly captures the DSP chain's pre-compression audio buffer at native quality
- **MP3 output** via ffmpeg with VBR encoding (`-qscale:a 2`)
- **Smart duration filtering** — checks actual WAV content duration (not wall-clock time) and discards recordings shorter than 3 seconds
- **Auto-silence detection** — stops recording after 3 seconds of silence
- **7-day auto-cleanup** of old recordings
- **Filename convention**: `{freq}MHz_{date}_{time}.mp3` (e.g. `118.7000MHz_20260209_173247.mp3`)

### 📁 Files Browser (`/files`)
- **Grouped by day and hour** — collapsible sections like `📁 09/02/2026 - Ore 18:00 (5)`
- **Sorted newest first** within each group
- **Spectrogram visualization** — real-time FFT spectrogram (Cooley-Tukey radix-2, Hann window, 256 bins) rendered on canvas for each recording
- **Waveform visualization** — amplitude waveform with blue→cyan→yellow color gradient
- **Click-to-seek** — click anywhere on the spectrogram/waveform to jump to that position
- **Playback position overlay** — semi-transparent highlight follows audio playback
- **Accurate duration** — uses `ffprobe` for server-side duration + browser `loadedmetadata` for real-time update
- **Audio preloading** — `preload="metadata"` so the player shows duration immediately
- **Download & Delete buttons** — always visible on every card
- **Compact dark-theme cards** — minimal footprint with inline metadata (frequency, time, duration, file size)
- **Empty state** handling with friendly message

### 🔴 REC Indicator
- **Blinking REC badge** in the main receiver UI when a recording is active
- **WebSocket status broadcast** — recorder pushes status to all connected clients via `ClientRegistry`

### 🎨 UI Enhancements
- **Custom branding** — "Powered by Dadaloop82" header persists (Header.js patched to not overwrite)
- **Dark-themed files page** — consistent with the main OpenWebRX+ aesthetic
- **Mobile-responsive** file cards with flex-wrap

Original OpenWebRX
=========

OpenWebRX is a multi-user SDR receiver software with a web interface.

![OpenWebRX](https://www.openwebrx.de/gfx/openwebrx-screenshot.png)

It has the following features:

- [csdr](https://github.com/jketterl/csdr) based demodulators (AM/FM/SSB/CW/BPSK31/BPSK63)
- filter passband can be set from GUI
- it extensively uses HTML5 features like WebSocket, Web Audio API, and Canvas
- it works in Google Chrome, Chromium and Mozilla Firefox
- supports a wide range of [SDR hardware](https://github.com/jketterl/openwebrx/wiki/Supported-Hardware#sdr-devices)
- Multiple SDR devices can be used simultaneously
- [digiham](https://github.com/jketterl/digiham) based demodularors (DMR, YSF, Pocsag, D-Star, NXDN)
- [wsjt-x](https://wsjt.sourceforge.io/) based demodulators (FT8, FT4, WSPR, JT65, JT9, FST4,
  FST4W)
- [direwolf](https://github.com/wb2osz/direwolf) based demodulation of APRS packets
- [JS8Call](http://js8call.com/) support
- [DRM](https://github.com/jketterl/openwebrx/wiki/DRM-demodulator-notes) support
- [FreeDV](https://github.com/jketterl/openwebrx/wiki/FreeDV-demodulator-notes) support
- M17 support based on [m17-cxx-demod](https://github.com/mobilinkd/m17-cxx-demod)

## Setup

The following methods of setting up a receiver are currently available:

- Raspberry Pi SD card images
- Debian repository
- Docker images
- Manual installation

Please checkout the [setup guide on the wiki](https://github.com/jketterl/openwebrx/wiki/Setup-Guide) for more details
on the respective methods.

## Community

If you have trouble setting up or configuring your receiver, you have some great idea you want to see implemented, or
you just generally want to have some OpenWebRX-related chat, come visit us over on
[our groups.io group](https://groups.io/g/openwebrx).

If you want to hang out, chat, or get in touch directly with the developers, receiver operators or users, feel free to
drop by in [our Discord server](https://discord.gg/gnE9hPz).

## Usage tips

You can zoom the waterfall display by the mouse wheel. You can also drag the waterfall to pan across it.

The filter envelope can be dragged at its ends and moved around to set the passband.

However, if you hold down the shift key, you can drag the center line (BFO) or the whole passband (PBS).
